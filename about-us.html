  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Kodeana was formed by three young female inspiring coders in 2018, who share a combined passion
for coding and cupcakes. After meeting at one of the CodeFirst:Girls enterprise courses, we decided
to put our loves together and manufacture and distribute our scrumptious cupcakes which are sold
through our user-friendly and interactive website, which we’ve built and maintained ourselves from
scratch.
In our factory based in Bromley South London we manufacture and make our delicious cupcakes.
Our cupcakes are made from a range of top quality ingredients ensuring that the cupcakes we
produce and sell, are extremely luxurious and delightful.
We produce a range of flavours ranging from sweet… think all kinds of chocolate, sweet icing and
colourful goodness, to exotic flavours featuring chilli and sweet tomato! – (proper fancy right!)</p>
<h2>Social enterprise</h2>
<p>Being forever grateful for being offered a place on one of Code First: Girls courses, we dedicate a
portion of our profits to the Code First: Girls 2020 campaign which aims to get another 20,000
women into the field of coding.</p>
